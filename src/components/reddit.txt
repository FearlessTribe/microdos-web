I have Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome which is a disorder due to a specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart involving an accessory pathway able to conduct electrical current between the atria and the ventricles, thus bypassing the atrioventricular node (pasted off of google so you can understand) irregular heart beat. Would micro dosing effect this at all?

Can anyone advise me on stacking (Stamet protocol)?

What are people's experiences of stacking vs not stacking?

Also, what strength Niacin is recommended?

Thanks.

I’m waiting for my Niacin to come in. I got my lions mane. I can’t wait to start it. I just started 100mg of psilocybin and I’ve only had two doses. So far so good. Let me know when you start. I’m making a journal :)

I am currently taking 100mg of Quetiapine but I want to try microdosing. Everything on Google says that it won’t work because Quetiapine will block the effects? Need some advice please.

Yeah, Seroquel can definitely blunt the effects since it hits a lot of the same receptors. If you’re on 100mg, don’t just drop it cold to test microdosing that can get real messy best move is to talk to your prescriber before changing anything so you don’t end up with withdrawal or a bad combo.

ADHD and mushrooms/microdosing

I’m looking for anyone here with an attention disorders who has experiences with taking psilocybin and/or micro dosing it. How were the experiences? Did they lessen or worsen the symptoms of your disorder? Would you recommend micro dosing for ADHD-related issues? Would you recommend other alternatives? Not looking for a cure, but ways to experiment.

Hey, I have ADHD and ASD. I've taken two cubensis trips and the experience has been good. About microdosing, I'm currently on week 3. The results are mixed, no changes in focus. But I'm more aware, and starting meditating as well. It was so messed up that I couldn't get myself to meditate. Things have been good emotionally, I'm finally consistent in my content (I'm a content creator). Other than that, I don't think it helps in executive function much. I will have to wait to know more, as it's only my 3rd week. :)

Help! Need info. Im a retired femalem . not new to the early drugs of the 70s but been awhile. I prefer natural medicine and want to start microdising psilocybin. Not to meet the creatures in other universes, but just enough to fight the aging depression ive been fighting. My son bought be a chocolate bar. He uses it and it's made a huge difference in his life. He weighs about 3 times my weight. And his dosage is 1/2 a bar , which gives him a nice little trip. 1/3 if he microdoses.

I do not want enough to risk paranoia... just enough to feel happy, energetic and to stop overthinking. I do have ADHD and PTSD. Not now nor ever been on medication for it. But it's getting to the point im going to need treatment. Im 110 pounds, 5'2. 63 years old. Anyone recommend a microdose i can begin with? I understand your advice is not medical recommendations. I just need a place to start. Thanks so much.

I'm petite aswell, i started the Fadiman protocol with 1 gram fresh truffles/0,33gram dried. (When you take mushrooms it is 1 gram fresh or 0,1 gram.) dried. You need a precision scale for proper dosing. I don't know the strength of the chocolate bar but you can try to devide a bar in 10 pieces and start with one little piece and after two weeks of md-ing you can try 2 little pieces of chocolate.

The right interval and timing of the doses is very individual. For depression and ptsd i advise starting with 1 small piece of chocolate every other day. After 2 weeks you can take 2 little pieces of chocolate if you want. After 6 to 8 weeks you have to take a break for 2 to 4 weeks (I advise the 2 week break for depression). During the md-ing it can be benificial to write or journal for reflection. You don't have to but it can help to gain insights in thought patterns that are beneficial or undermining for healing the depression.

I have therapy resistent depression, adhd and cptsd. After 5 weeks of md-ing i tried the 5 days on/ 2 days off scedule for one week and had good progress on it. After this week i took a 2 week break to prevent therapy resistence. Dose in the evening so the brain can get the rest it needs.

Wishing you well!

Hi, I am trying microdosing for the first time , Fadiman protocol, Last day i microdose i had a headache the entire day. Maybe it’s not related but i am going to be monitoring it in case it happens again next time. Does anyone had that side effect? If it happens again Does it mean that that i should lower de dose?

I'm currently taking ssris and other anti anxiety and anti depressants. I would love to propose trying micro dosing mushrooms to my dr. I've heard great success from people I know who have switched from pharmaceuticals to psilocybin after proposing the change to their psychiatrist. I'm curious if any of y'all have had any success with a medical professional. I've been on my medication for years now and I'm worried about long term effects and feel like they've only helped so much. I definitely need more help.

I'm in health care and have been very very slowly reducing my dose of ssri while microdosing. On month 5 now and so far really good. I also did a macro dose which may have also helped. I'm also a guide and can share that people have microdosed for a year, making sure to have the off days, and take a 3 week break after 6 months. The main reason to have the breaks is to not create tolerance. Like you said, they help so much! I ditto that!

What many new to the topic don't understand is that purchasing true psilocybin online is still illegal in most states in the US. I have yet to see one website selling them, that is selling actual genuine psilocybin. Please be careful. At least once a week, I am contacted by people who have sent hundreds of dollars to an online company hoping to get real magic mushroom capsules. Most get nothing, and those who do, get capsule of who knows what... Sourcing is the hardest part of this... To help, I have written an article that I share with my personal clients... hope it helps! https://www.patreon.com/posts/124952820?collection=434664

Ok, thread started. Does anyone know if TSA/airlines and their sniffer dogs have the ability or interest in screening for psilocybin? I have an upcoming flight within the US and want to take some psilocybin-imbedded chocolate squares with me. The total amount would be less than 5 grams, if amount matters. Any information appreciated.

Have been microdosing for 20 days, 120mcg every 3rd day via SoulCybin Cocoa. I'm not expecting to feel any psychoactive change but currently have not noticed any real change at all. Am I expecting too much too soon? Am I underdosing? 6'2/225. I love the idea of finally getting better control of my Combat PTS and anxiety. Just not seeing anything. Feel kind of let down.

Do you feel anything the day you take it? I hear form people at least weekly who are purchasing fake capsules form bad people taking advantage of people who want to heal... There are also many factors at play... How is the medicine grown? Who grows it? (It matters) What strain are you taking (They are all very different) I have 30 years expereicnce supporting people with mental health healing, and have great expereince in the psilocybin space. I'd be happy to help you fine tune to find what you need to get healed...

I definitely do feel a very very slight.... I wouldn't even call it a buzz.... Just a slightly tangible shift in perception. I adapt to it quickly and forget about it but it definitely has been repeatable each time I dose. This is more noticeable when I went up to 150mg at my 225lb body weight.

My only warning about SoulCybin as a business is that they auto enrolled me in a subscription that I didn't catch. A month into exploring whether or not MD is right for me, I got hit with an unexpected charge which came in at 5pm Central time on a Friday, (their offices close at 3pm Eastern). By the time I received any feedback "The order has already been filled and shipped". That kind of business behavior isn't illegal but is far enough onto the shady meter to not inspire me to do further business with them.

It took more than a month to really notice that I don't trigger nearly as much, hardly at all, for the last week and a half... I've been journaling to track and seem to be moving in a positive direction.

Whether or not it is psychosomatic / placebo effect I'm honestly not sure... But I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.

I do find that on dosing days, I do feel more consistent in my focus at work.

That's fantastic! If you're seeing the results you want and that's exactly where you need to be. I found that introducing different strains allows me to custom tailor my daily microdose to my current needs both emotionally and mentally. It's always fun to explore different areas within the microdosing realm. We are all a little bit different. I noticed a difference within the first day but I know for other people it takes a little longer to really notice what's changed. The subtlety is the magic.

I get so frustrated when I hear things like that. We're here to help people heal not to take their money. That is definitely shady business behavior... But the fact that they have a website open for the world to see tells me that they are probably not giving you true psilocybin mushrooms. That would be illegal. A lot of companies have websites selling microdosing capsules that don't genuinely have any psilocybin in them. That way if they ever caught by law enforcement, they can say that there's nothing illegal in their capsules. It's very frustrating. So just be careful.

One of my clients actually discovered that her microdosing capsules were nothing but dried mushrooms from the store with just a sprinkling of some kind of a psychedelic chemical... Not psilocybin. It's shameful behavior.

It sounds like you were definitely feeling what you need to be. Do you feel like you were getting the mental and emotional support that you need with the capsules? Do you know what strain you're taking? And do you know how it was grown and who grew it? (Strain makes a huge difference!)

Hi there I've just started taking ' functinal mycelium micro dosing' capsules from Dinosaur healing. I've been taking 0.2g, 2 days off 1 day on and after a week I've seen no benefit yet. I have a month's worth of tablets. I've been diagnosed ADHD and not currently medicating with anything else. Should I look to maybe take 2 tablets per day to see if I can feel any effect , or keep going on the current dosage for the time being in the hope that I might feel something after taking it for longer?

I'm so disgusted by how companies have tried to capitalize on the microdosing train. Functional Mycelium? That is not going to give you nearly the psilocybin you need. almost none actually... This is how companies can sell them online because they aren't real "magic mushrooms" - There are SO many factors that need to be looked at... Maybe you can find some support here: https://www.patreon.com/collection/434664?view=expanded

Hi. Will begin m/d following the fadiman protocol on Wednesday (waiting for olanzapine to leave system). I'm planning to take 0.4mg of ground shrooms in order to try to find my 'threshold'. Am I being impatient in not wanting to go slow and low to start? Historical doses have been between 3.5 & 7gms so I'm not adverse to tripping. Will be stacking with lions mane and niacin.

Any advice or experiences gladly taken x

Alright I see. What’s your current dose and how long have you been on it? I’ve read that people have been recommended a wash out period of 2 weeks to 3 months before the receptors are able to fully absorb the psilocybin. I’ve started MDing and I feel tired and a bit nauseous….

Has anyone ever experimented with micro dosing throughout the day? I’m wondering if it has an impact after your first one. For example, I usually take one in the morning and then not again for the entire day. I was wondering what it would be like to possibly take another one in the afternoon will it have any impact at all? I takea .15 g capsule.

I'm quitting antidepressants I've been taking for anxiety and found some microdosing capsules that I'm interested to try for anxiety and stress support. I've never microdosed mushrooms before but I've taken them recreationally when I was younger. For those of you who are experienced with microdosing, what are your thoughts on this combination of ingredients for managing anxiety:

‣ 100MG I Psilocybin Mushrooms ‣ 100MG|L-Theanine ‣ 50MG |Ashwagandha ‣ 50MG I CBD ‣ 50MG | Reishi ‣ 25MG |5-HTP ‣ 25MG | Flush Free Ni

I’m also on Effexor and have been looking into MD. Do you feel any positive effect when micro dosing despite being on antidepressants? Apparently they occupy the same receptor in the brain so the experience is watered down. I am wondering if it’s any use to start micro dosing before I’m off Effexor completely….

Does anybody here smoke weed daily and micro doses mushrooms? Wondering how they react to each other.

I want to try microdosing to help with my mental health. After 18 years of chronic back pain I’ve been struggling the last 18 months dealing with it mentally and I need some help to get me feeling good about life again. I want to smile and be in a good mood even if I’m in pain. I smoke weed for sleep and helps distract me from pain. Maybe the microdosing will make me feel so good I won’t need weed during daytime but I don’t think I can sleep without it.

Any weed smokers microdosing with advise is appreciated.

From experience what do you think is better for microdosing capsules or fresh ?

Hi @repsu50 I’m a micro dosing guide and I could have some words or knowledge for you and your situation. First I feel for you and understand that chronic pain is very difficult for most, I commend you for reaching out to search for ways to feel better and re-find joy. I believe you will find the option that works best for you soon. Firstly cannabis and mushrooms work cohesively together in a really beautiful way, but they work differently. Although you never know until you try, one doesn’t usually work as a substitute for the other. It seems cannabis serves a purpose in your life, to help you sleep and maybe manage pain symptoms, you should look at microdosing with curiosity because we don’t know yet how mushrooms will work with you. If you are relying on marijuana in ways that don’t serve you microdong has been shown to be a really promising tool to break any sort of bad habit or even addiction, but if this doesn’t apply then microdosing has also shown a lot of promise when it comes to everything it seems you are looking to manage like symptoms of depression, to add joy and laughter back in your life, to soften the mind, and even lift you up and out of any darkness or low point you are going through. My recommendation is to use the two together and then to see how your relationship with mushrooms develops over time. It has the potential to point you in the right direction whether that means keeping cannabis as an ally or supporting you in moving on from it

Hi! I have just tried mushrooms for the first time, and took enough to have a little trip, which I’m fine with. But I don’t know how often I need to dose?

Hi! I’m a microdosing guide and can offer some guidance. I would recommend lowering your dose to an amount that doesn’t make you feel you are having a trip, even one that is little. Start at a dose that helps you feel supported but not disconnected from who you are on a day to day basis, we can this “subperceptual”. You want to take this a few times a week for around 30 days, there are different recommended protocols

Just starting microdosing a few days ago (not new to mushrooms have taken large amounts on several occasions years ago, but new to microdosing), I've been feeling much calmer and happier but I'm so sleepy all day long after taking it. Does anyone else have this problem. Maybe it's that my anxiety hasn't let me sleep well in years and on the mushrooms I'm finally calm so my body wants me to finally sleep. I feel like I could sleep for days.

Hi! I’m a microdosing guide and can offer some insight, and believe you hit the nail on the head. The sleepiness is often just that, sleepiness , the fault lies in the way so many of us have been taught to run far away from rest and see the desire or need to rest as a problem, when it’s not. The sleepiness can be two things, one a call for you to slow down and rest more, or, in some occasions it can be a matter of lowering your dose or finding a strain that works better for you

I’ve just started microdosing. I’ve never done shrooms before. The lady at the mushroom place recommended a strain called limitless since I need it for energy. I find that it’s making me very hot and slightly anxious. Is this normal? Does it fade? Should I go lower than 100mg? Thnx

I've read the best method for true microdoing is to homogenize them and test the batch so you can plan for an accurate dose. Even flushes can vary. If you're looking for a therapeutic experiment, measure and record. They make kits for measuring the strength. They're pretty neat.

There is no way to measure accurately by eye. For micro-dosing the amount is so small that you should get a scale that can weigh milligrams (it is cheap). Tomorrow when I microdose I'll take a picture to show you.
My scale measures from 200 grams to 10 milligrams and that is precise enough.
I advise you to weigh it because for me 400mg is the maximum I feel as a comfortable safe micro-dose to work and just go about my day. Sometimes a dose of 500mg or 600mg can already get me on a small trip, but enough of a trip that I don't wanna be working or dealing with any serious high-functioning responsibility. Sometimes I take 500mg on the weekend when I will be just taking care of my apartment or doing some hobby. By the way, I've been wanting to try biking on a dirty road with that dose of 500/600mg.

It's important to understand that even when you weigh it, the concentration of psilocybin varies through the body of mushrooms, so you can take exactly the same amount two times and have one dose being noticeably stronger than the other. So that's is why I think it's important to measure accurately and experiment progressively increasing the dose to understand how you feel with different doses.
And it's nice to know your amounts so you can take the perfect doses for different situations with confidence.

And just for context, I'm autistic, so I can be sensitive and more easily get overstimulated with psilocybin.
Also, I'm now on my second go on the Sataments Staks protocol, which I recommend.

keep it g <3

Just tried micro dosing at 125 mg my first try and then having a ceremony to go to I tried 250 milligrams. First time was with capsules second time was chocolate. They had a strain called mood and at 125 mg I can tell you I could have gone about my life but the only difference I felt was I was in an extremely good mood. I feel like I got more effects than my friend and I'm wondering if it's because I took my painkiller at the same time well close to the same time.. does anybody have any experience in mixing their daily pain medication with microdosing

Hi guys, i'm new to microdosing and i'd need a very simple help, does anyone know which type of balance do i need to measure the right quantity for microdosing? I'm using Cubensis mushrooms.

A 0,01 balance would be enough? Or is it better to use a 0,001?

Thank you everyone!

I just started too. Only lions' mane, and I'm using gummies. Dosing is per the Stamet's stack protocol. I did some reading beforehand, and started with one 2.5mg gummy.

Can you explain what a 0,001 balance is? Is that a ratio, or do you go by milligrams (mg) of 2 or more types of mushroom?

Hey there! I just got some .25g capsules from a friend, but don’t know what to expect from them. Should I take them on a day off? Or a day that I work? I don’t like the anxiety I sometimes get from a higher heart rate from THC edibles. is psilocybin similar?

First microdosing adventure today with 0.12g of GT mushrooms. I’ve tripped before but never more than 1.5g per trip. Took on an empty stomach and at first felt at a bit scatter brained. I tried to do a couple of word puzzles to test my mental shape and it was more difficult. After about 2 hours it cleared up and I had some energy, felt a bit more open and outgoing and my mood noticeably improved, but after about 4 hours the effects waned. I’m aware that any of this things could be placebo but I can’t deny that I felt different after taking, very very subtle but a nice boost to my day and effects that I can really benefit from at work.

Edit: also 2 other things I noticed but were very subtle, the text on my phone and laptop looked a lot more crystal clear for whatever reason, and also I swear I saw small flashes of light that moved when I closed my eyes but that has to be placebo because I would not expect anything visual on such a small dose

I have no experience as I don‘t have any nerve-damages. I would say it really depends on what kind of nerve damage your husband has (due to autoimmune disease? what part of what nerves is damaged or causing pain?). I am really into neuro science and also drugs/psychedelics science and would like to help you with this question. All-in-all the neuroplasticity can get enormously activated by drugs such as Magic Mushrooms, LSD, Ayahuasca. That means the ability of especially the brain, but also of the periphereric nervous system, to grow new nervous connections and re-organize the structure of our complex nervous system. Also the ability of the nervous system to heal itself by repairing damaged nerves has been observed days to weeks after application.

But your husband really has to think about it if he seriously is ready. The effects that he needs for his healing are secondary, the psychedelics can have other strong effects in long-term-use (positive or negative), even if positive some people dont want to change their perception and mind.

We can chat about this further if you want.

Hey guys a few questions. So I have had shrooms before like maybe a 1 -1.5 not grams but actual shroom stems I guess you can say . I want to start a micro journey I guess to help w some mental clarity , I hadn’t done it in a long time just cause I felt like I wasn’t where I wanted to be mentally and I just rather not shroom like that. (I do smoke pot daily ) I want to learn about micro-dosing to help a bit w social anxiety and like I said some clarity.

I guess I would like to ask people’s reasoning as to why they micro dose? And what have you noticed?

If I just have shrooms should I just weigh them out or should I blend it to powder and in capsules lol??

How often should I do it ? Any thoughts help:)

I’m curious and terrified at the same time. I’ve read about the benefits of micro dosing and want to try it but part of me is anxious to give up some control. It isn’t just psychedelics but also simple surgeries like lasik or wisdom teeth. If I was to micro dose what do I have to worry about? Also what’s a good dose if I do a chocolate or straight mushroom?

Am I supposed to have a person to sit and be with me when I microdose the first time? Little bit of background, on me, I have severe panic attacks and anxiety, depression as well. My kids go to school during the day, so I'm home with my dog and my roommate (who's also a good friend) and her daughter who lives downstairs. Should I ask her to sit with me while I try it the first time? Also, how do you recommend I do it, like every day, every other day? I'm not sure how to go about this, but I have the stuff, I've had it for a while now. I'm just a little scared or nervous, I guess, to try it out. I should also mention that as a teenager the first few times I had done it, I did lots, I had a good time but then they started to become bad trips. I guess that's where the fear of trying microdosing comes in. Any advice or tips would be amazing. Thank you!

So, my mum, 60 years old, never touched any natural medicines (weed or psychedelics) in her life. She’s only ever drank alcohol so in 60 years has literally never entered this world. At the moment she is very stressed, and kind of mentally unwell even though she tries to hide it. She has put on a lot of weight the past few years as it’s been a rough couple years for the family. I see the toll the past few years have taken in her face. She wants to try microdosing for a month as for me it’s been beneficial. I’m just wondering, is it safe for her? The capsules are 0.2g of Mycelium and the dosage is recommended 2 days on 1 day off. Will she have a lot of benefits? Could she also have some negative sides too? Like I really wouldn’t want my mum to develop something like derealisation or anything, that would be scary for her. I was microdosing for 3 months and after a while I started to experience DPDR however I realised that it may have been because I was microdosing alongside taking a high dose of an antidepressant and I also dropped my dose drastically shortly before I experienced these symptoms so I never really found out what they were from. Anyway - the point of my question is will this bring profound changes to her life or likely to just mess up her head even more? Any info will be very much appreciated. Thank you ❤️

I only know a fraction of the fungi/shroom world but I would suggest to definitely give it a few months trial with good research and journaling as I believe it's alot like meditation,, each to their own and we have to try to see what suits best individually. ☯️

Good luck on your journey and I hope you find some relief for your mum 🕉️

1/10 or 2/10 of a gram depending on strain that you are using.

Always dehydrate till cracker dry. Can use silica packs to keep shrooms dry till grinder time.

I use a $15 black & decker coffee grinder.

Then cap them w/ a capsule machine: 100 ct. / size 3 caps.

200mg can be a lot depending on how you tolerate Psilly. I have patients who dose 85mg-500mg. It's important to find your baseline and work from there. Every person processes differently. Strain matters as well. I personally dose 165 mg and stay away from Amazonian type strains because they give me intense anxiety and affect my heart rate. Happy to chat more.

This is why I started micro dosing. After quitting a 20 year alcohol habit, based in self medication from trauma and neurodivergence, I needed help dealing with the shame, depression, anxiety, etc. Long story short. I'll celebrate 4 years of sobriety with no relapses and a completely changed outlook with better coping skills to deal with said shame, depression, anxiety. I also have patients who have successfully done the same. It's literally life changing and life saving. Happy to talk more.

I’ve noticed since microdosing shrooms, that movies have changed for me. Its like the actors are just people acting now. Hard to get into the story. In fact it’s getting harder to take anything seriously. I also turn away from negative news stories. It seems selfish but I don’t want to here about “natural disasters, war murder etc. There’s around 350 million people in the US alone and a guy gets pushed onto a Subway track. Tragic yes but do I have to hear about for a fucking week ? My only concern right now is learning to play the tin whistle. I still work and pay the bills but … Anyway it seems like a good thing for me. Anybody else ? Anyone else get this ?

Do you guys take it as supplements or grow them on your own and take it. Which one is better? I look at Paul Stamets shop also there are many supplements difficult to chose. I don’t know if they have shipments to Europe.

Is that also help with people with autoimmune disease to reduce the inflammation of the body and chronic pains and tiresome ?!

Hello I've been using Paul's stamet's protocol and stack and microdosing 3 years now. It's helped immensely, my depression is gone and sometimes my anxiety is better but most the time lately it seems to be getting worse. Like I am too aware of my anxious thoughts, people pleasing habits and why I am having them and my social anxiety is worse too. It's like they are showing me what I need to heal but I don't know what to do about it. I do see a counselor regularly. I've started meditating and journaling perhaps I just need to do that more regularly.? Any ideas welcome.

Also, make your journal your link to God (or higher self, universe, divine….whatever works for you. When you write talk directly and then use your therapist as someone to simply talk about that with. Your most important therapist, relationship is with your higher self (or like I said whatever you call it).

Maybe your dose is too high. That happens for me too when the dose is higher than micro. Sometimes it’s good because it is important info but not everyday

I suffer from PMDD (post menstrual dysphoria disorder) I get severe mood swings, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. I smoke insane amounts of marijuana.

I started microdosing everyday 150 mg for the past two days, and I felt WONDERFUL after taking the first dose. I told myself I won't take it daily, but around 3 pm my mood SWITCHED, I ended up taking another one yesterday and felt extremely dull. I'm just trying to understand is this normal with microdosing? Or is this my mood swings that was intensified? I was raged, and VERY SAD. empty. Hopeless.

Hey there, I've been researching mding and now I get a million ads on my socials for different companies. What are some reputable sources or companies? It's hard to cut through the online marketing bs.

Also, would love to hear some real life testimonies of how microdosing has helped with mental health. I would really love to get off SSRIs - I struggle with depression, mild anxiety, cPTSD, lack of focus and concentration, and exhaustion. I am a little nervous about medication interactions. Has anyone had SSRI interactions with the mushrooms? I'm on Wellbutrin and Prozac.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Mushrooms can interact with SSRIs like prozac. They both act on Serotonin. Serotonin Syndrome is a real concern particularly when taking psilocybin at large doses or low doses regularly with another medication that increases Serotonin. Serotonin Syndrome can be deadly.

I have been taking 120 mg of psilocybin, 800 mg of lion's mane, and B3 (Niacin)- every 3 days. I wanted to speak to people who are doing something similar and also go to the gym. Has anyone done this and taken the dose before a workout?

I tried mushrooms for the first time last week and took way too much, plus I had been drinking. These choices led to a terrible trip where I relived buried trauma. It was a horrible night—I felt like I was dying.

Interestingly, the next three days were very different in a positive way. My anxiety and stress were significantly reduced, and I felt genuinely happy. Even with stressful situations that had come up, they didn't bother me as much, and I maintained a positive and relaxed mindset. It felt like the effects of that night were lingering, and I hadn't felt that happy in years.

I've struggled with significant stress and anxiety for the last three years, and recently, minor depression. Nothing has really worked, and I was about to start medication for depression and anxiety until I spoke to a friend about my experience and she told me about microdosing and how it has significantly helped her.

After researching and talking to more friends about their experiences, I want to try microdosing before turning to pharmaceuticals. I plan to start with the lowest dose possible (I don't weigh much) and ensure the source is reputable, I found utopia mushrooms on another Reddit form. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated for someone who’s just starting their journey.

i (entirely!) cured depression with 0.1g (dry mushrooms, since fresh ones weight more) every 3 days (monday one, tuesday/wednesday nothing, thursday one, and so on), and 10 doses = a month.
zero alcohol during the whole month, too...
depression was gone by 70% after the first dose, totally gone after the second. i'm at over a month after the end of this protocol and my mood is still stable af, i just can't believe it, it's insane!

so yeah, i'd recommend that, it's a known protocol to start with, and hope it'll do the same for you! :)

I had the same question, and my psychiatrist explained to me that mushrooms may have no effect at all while you are taking any medication that acts on Serotonin (Lexapro) because psychoactive mushrooms also act on serotonin. This may not be the case for you, from what I understand it varies by person, but if they don't work that may be why :)

I get a lot of Facebook ads from small businesses selling microdosing products like capsules of powdered golden teacher and chocolate infused in measured doses. It’s still illegal but they say it’s for religious sacrament, referencing indigenous religions that are exempt. I took a gamble on one and had good success. But buyer beware and I wouldn’t generally recommend buying from the internet. DC has legalized shrooms and you can get them in dispensaries.

Hi I am new here. I have been microdosing for almost 5 months. I was doing 2 days on and 2 off and then taking a full month off. Then I went to dosing a day or 2 a week and then had a few weeks off and now have been doing 4 days on and then a week and half off. I dose half of .1 up to .2. I find it can feel intense and I can feel jittery and agitated. Like I want to run away from my own body. It can increase anxiety some days and agitate me. When I started it made me happy and calm and I wanted to be out doors. I am not sure if I am not taking enough or if I am doing something wrong with it. Yesterday I cried heaps on it and felt like I released a lot. Not really what I was going for though. Any tips would be great. Feels little lonely on this journey. I also get an achy body and get a bit tired. I’m getting some other mushrooms to use too, lions mane and a bunch of others for my health hoping this helps with this part.

This is all so interesting and new. I am also looking for answers/dialogue. I started in February 2024 for 6 weeks. 2 days on/2 off. .2 g. Toward end I did increase by 2. I do believe they helped me. Stopped for a few weeks due to a different health issue. Started two Thursdays ago, taking one a day (.5 g) for 5 days while in Berkeley Springs, WV for a couple of spa sessions (I work my ass off to be able to do this). I am not sure if it was all shrooms or the addition of the spa treatments but I have felt great since then. I was surprised when I was actually happy at work this past week. I took 2 days off. Will do 4 days on and 2 days off. I will keep it at the same dosage for another week. At this point it has been trial and error but we have to start somewhere. I am hoping for more discussion here.

I have had absolutely no side effects. I blend mine into powder so I am getting caps and stems all mixed and fill capsules.

My dad was bipolar back in the 1950s when they knew very little how to treat it. Unfortunately he was in state hospitals and my mom was told more than one he would die. The last time they tried LSD because they ran out of options. My dad lived to be 80 years old and never took lithium or any other psych drugs (except when he first got out and mainly in the fall for a few years). Never had a maniac or depressive episode after that. We were quite lucky!! My sister, who was also bipolar, was seeing a psychiatrist and he was fascinated by my dad. He said my dad was the only true bipolar patient he ever knew who did not have to be on any psych drugs. My family believes it was because of LSD. So I know it works!! For the record, I am not doing LSD.

I've been microdosing since June of last year and I started feeling the effects the following month. I've been doing 3 days on 4 days off. I started with a dose of .25mg-.3mg. And I actually started decreasing my antidepression medication. I'm almost completely off my meds now just through the help of microdosing and I've never felt better emotionally. I'm up to around .5mg-.6mg to account for the decrease in antidepressants but I don't feel any crazy trips or anything. Sometimes I take an afternoon nap and have cool dreams during it, but that's it.

Anyone else feel like they get body aches and flu like for the first hour or two after the dose kicks in? It’s bizarre and it sucks, but then I have a great mood after! Wondering if I continue, if this symptom will stop. Or am I the only person who has this occur

There could be a chance that what you got wasn't fully dehydrated enough, and the moisture basically makes it feel like you've got mild food poisoning for a bit. I've had this happen a few times myself. I tried throwing a silica packet in the bag to try to help I'll let you know if I notice a difference

Good day,

I just took 2.2grams of GT yesterday for my first trip in 20+ years - great time.

I’m wondering how long I need to wait, if at all, to get back on my micro dosing schedule for psilocybin?

Thanks

Good Morning

I was wondering if I were to microdose 5 days and on and 2 days off if I’ll still build up a tolerance?

The goal is to do a macro dose for my first journey this Sunday (2-2.5grams) and I’m going to be micro dosing Monday-Friday or I could do till Thursday so I have 2 days off before.

My question is: “Will I build up a tolerance with the micro dose that will affect my macro dose come Sunday?”

Thank you!

Hey if anyone is in here… I’m looking into microdosing to get off my antidepressants, I prefer how I feel off them but they’re needed. Boomers have helped me for a few years (1 trip every 6 months or so, dosage is typically 2.5-3.5 g per trip)

I want to just be able to grind them and put them in gel capsules so I can feel like me more often. Where can I get more information about it?

Anyone try microdosing for weed withdrawal? I need to quit weed and I’m so over smoking but the withdrawals are so bad and last so long that I can’t ever make it more than a month and smoke again. I have anxiety as is so the with withdrawals make it worse. I only started smoking cause of health issues and now I can’t stop cause of the horrible weed withdrawals. I’m thinking of doing .1 dry shrooms and following one of the protocols. No stacking just the shrooms. Any help or advice is appreciated.

If you’re interested in sourcing them, grow them yourself. There are numerous resources to learn and spores are not illegal to possess, EdenShrooms is where I bought my first set of spores. Pure psilocybin is available for purchase as a research drug but I’m not aware of any permits needed for it, plus it’s like 70 bucks for a mg

Taking one capsule of 200 mg won’t make it obvious you’ve taken it. There have been many reports of big-name CEO microdosing this amount at work. I also use this much to focus on something if needed.

Heres what I feel when I take 1 capsule:

Depending on how much I have eaten prior to taking it, my come up could be between 40 mins to an hour. Sometimes it has taken over an hour to hit me if I’ve had a big meal during the day. I have slow metabolism so I’m guessing that’s why.

When it starts to hit, for at least the next 30-40 mins you will be slightly shaky, increased heart rate, like you’ve had a stronger hit of caffeine. That’s it. Be ready to be slightly buzzing for a bit before you feel truly calm. Maybe go for a walk, time it so it’s lunch time when your come up is happening and then that way you can step away from your desk for at least an hour.

Once it calms down after 30-40 mins (at least that’s it for me) then I feel a lift in my mood. I feel more motivated to complete a task. I’m more focused on the task once I’ve started it. I’m more social, so a little bit chatty. Music sounds better. You will NOT feel high (like you’ve smoked too much weed and can’t focus). You’ll be completely sober, just a bit more energized.

This should last for a few hours. There’s no crash. You’ll be able to deliver everything, without it being obvious you’ve taken anything.

I work from home and have several meetings and projects going on and where I would have been overwhelmed normally, I felt chill. Cliche but I felt cool calm and collected! I highly recommend.

I plan on stopping (an MAOI antidepressant) parnate for a bit then microdosing on shrooms for a month or so. I’ve read and heard (first hand) what a great experience people have had, long term. It’s a really low dose .2. So I can do all my usual activities. I don’t feel comfortable taking it with the parnate. Hence the stopping. Do you think a two week washout would be enough, god help me! Thanks. Also, if anyone else has done it, I’d love some feedback. Cheers

Yes! I micro-dosed 2 days in a row literally a week from today and I had so much suppressed emotions come to the surface. Granted I did go through a traumatic experience last year, but I believe it just gave me a release from things I never tried healing from. As days went on I felt myself coming back together and now 7 days later I feel better. I want to continue it bc I genuinely feel like there’s still emotions inside me that need out, but it was definitely an experience that whooped my ass.

It could, depending on what is going on in your world. After a microdose you may find yourself more in touch with your emotions. You may be happy or sad, laughing or crying. All part of the journey. Or you may feel nothing at all, but over time you rewire.

About 2 months ago I added Lion's Mane Tincture and Cordyseps Tincture from Susquehanna Sustainable Enterprises www.susquehannasustainability.com I had been on 5 different medications for decades for depression and anxiety. 2 weeks ago, I weened off of the last pill. I feel better today than I have my entire 54 years of life!

I’m curious is anyone on here knows anything about whether taking a larger dose will throw off microdosing? I have been microdosing the past week but I would love to take a higher dose today for fun. Is that going to affect me?

Hi, I’m really interested in microdosing but I’m worried because I’ve been struggling with panic disorder for the past few months and also don’t like weed as it makes me really paranoid/anxious. Does anyone have any insight as to whether microdosing could help with my anxiety/depression, or do u think it could make the panic disorder worse?

Thank you for your kind words but it’s important to understand milligrams versus grams. There are 1000 mg in 1 g.
It’s essential not to get this mixed up.

First timer with mushrooms and first time Microdosing. Just acquired an eighth of golden teachers from a reliable source over the weekend. According to my reading over the last year, the Plan is to freeze them, then grind them to pepper consistency in a coffee grinder. Lastly, weigh them carefully on a digital scale for 25 mg (aka .025g; I’m a numbers guy) and consume them mixed with honey . I hope to regain my youthful optimism (I’m 61), and be prepared for an end of life anxiety whenever that day comes. looks like I will have to do this solo because I don’t have a choice. I think it’s safe because it’s such a low dosage. Any comments?

I started with 300mg and increased to 70mg every day until I started to be way too happy. I learned that I should start slower and take 2 days off before my body gets used to it and I will have to increase more and more. So I started again with 200mg /2 days off which didn't do much for me then I moved to 200mg with only one day off. I will eventually find the right spot. After reading more and more about the science of this, It looks like it's better to do 2 "trips" before starting micro-dosing. I plan to try that and after that sea

I just read that 25mg would be around 2.5 gram roughly as levels vary a bit. But it's an approximate, so 1.75 gram would be 17.5mg. 1 gram being 10mg. Regardless of what's what. I hope you get what you want from you're microdosing journey.

So when I started microdosing, I completely and abruptly stopped my adderall. I was taking 30mg @6am and 20mg@1pm

I did not have any withdrawals, or notice a lack of focus. Almost the opposite honestly. I have since reincorporated adderall back into my daily medications. Although I no longer have the need for it, I do use it for days I know are going to be detail and focus driven. Not daily.

I'd imagine your tolerance would rise - with everything from alcohol to heroin we build a tolerance but I'm no expert. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable sees your post cos I'm interested to know too. I've been md'ing for the last 2 days to help with coming off anti depressants, I feel fine so far but 2 days isn't long enough to know of it'll work. Fingers crossed!

I don't know the exact amounts - which you should obviously find out but a micro dose is roughly 10% percent of a full dose. for most cubensis you'd take 3.5 - 4 grams so a microdose is .35 - .4 of a gram. I took my first microdose today so we'll see

hi, not sure if this lounge will be of any help but I'm looking to acquire some psilocybin for microdosing purposes. In the UK, so possession is legal for personal use, but supply is a crime... (cont)

It’s all about trial and error until you find your sweet spot.

It’s always recommended to start low.

Preferably choose a day off to take your first dose.

The recommended quantities are:

Dried truffles: from 0.2 - 1 gram

Fresh microdosing truffles: 0.5 - 2 grams

Dried mushrooms: 0.1 - 0.3 grams

With microdosing, it’s best to deal with dried substances rather than fresh products. As long as a mushroom is fresh, it is very difficult to maintain a consistent strength with every dose you take. This applies slightly less to truffles, because the density is many times higher.
